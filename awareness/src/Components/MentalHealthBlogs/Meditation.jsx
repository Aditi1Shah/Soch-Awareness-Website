          Meditation refers to a category of techniques that are used to achieve
          a heightened sense of awareness, focus, and compassion. For spiritual
          practitioners, it’s also often a way to reach enlightenment. <br />
          <br />
          Although meditation is most commonly associated with Eastern spiritual
          practices like Buddhism and Hinduism, other religions have
          historically used meditation as well. For example, meditation, or
          reflecting on Jesus, is an important part of the Catholic rosary. Many
          non-religious groups also practice secular meditation Mindfulness
          meditation¹, a practice with its roots in Buddhism, invites the
          practitioner to pay close attention to the present moment, usually by
          anchoring focus on the in-breath and the out-breath. Some meditation
          practitioners focus on something else, like external sounds or a
          mantra.
          <br />
          <br />
          The scientific research proves what spiritual teachers have been
          saying for centuries: a regular meditation practice greatly improves
          overall well-being. Not only have scientists found that there are all
          kinds of physical benefits that people experience when they meditate,
          but this ancient practice can also help improve our mental health.

          <h1 className="titlestepfirst">1) Concentration And Focus</h1>
          <p className="parastepfirst">
            A common image that arises in our minds when we think about a
            meditator is that of an old monk, isolated from society and never
            breaking their intense concentration on their breathing, not even
            for a second. This focus is the brain benefit that most people
            probably first think of when they think of meditation. <br />
            <br />
            In reality, that’s not usually what meditation looks like. An
            experienced meditator might be able to sit for hours at a time
            without breaking focus, but we’re human; it’s natural for our brains
            to wander. The practice of meditation is noticing when our thoughts
            go off the rails and bringing them back to the present moment.{" "}
            <br />
            <br />
            In practicing mindfulness meditation, we develop better focus
            overall. Even brief daily meditation has been shown to improve
            executive attention² and helps us to maintain focus on tasks for
            longer periods of time.

          Anxiety is the most common mental illness³ seen in the U.S.
          population, and around 20 percent of Americans are estimated to suffer
          from anxiety disorders in any given year. While more severe cases of
          anxiety may require additional treatment like psychiatric medications,
          meditation has helped thousands of people with mild to moderate
          anxiety feel less stressed.
          <br />
          <br />
          Even people with severe anxiety have reported a lessening of their
          symptoms with a daily meditation practice. Meditation, especially deep
          breathing techniques, regulates the physical effects of anxiety; it
          reduces the levels of cortisol and catecholamine in the brain⁴ –
          chemicals that cause anxiety symptoms, and promotes mood-boosting
          chemicals, like dopamine. On top of that, a regular practice can help
          us to think more clearly, and give stressful situations in our lives
          less importance.

          <h1 className="titlestepfirst">3) Increased Self Awareness</h1>
          <p className="parastepfirst">
            One of the many benefits of psychotherapy is that it comes with the
            opportunity to get to know oneself on a deeper level. This
            self-awareness can lead to better choices that are more in line with
            our needs and wants; research⁵ shows that higher levels of
            self-awareness lead to better self-esteem and increased
            productivity.
            <br />
            <br />
            Meditation involves long periods of sitting with yourself and your
            deepest thoughts … with no outside distractions. As a result, those
            who regularly practice mindfulness meditation start to understand
            their true nature much more deeply. Regular meditators experience
            more self-awareness and increased self-esteem in comparison with the
            general population.

          Sleep is a vital part of your overall well-being; if you aren’t
          sleeping well enough or long enough, you put yourself at risk for all
          kinds of health problems, including heart disease and diabetes.
          Luckily, meditation can help: research shows that mindfulness
          meditation improves REM sleep⁶ and leads to less insomnia, fatigue,
          and depression. If you find yourself struggling to wind down before
          bedtime, a relaxation meditation practice may help. If you make it
          part of your nightly routine, then it’s more likely that you’ll be
          able to stick to it. With the help of meditation, you’ll start to feel
          more and more relaxed and be able to consistently get some restful
          sleep.

          <p className="parastepfirst">
            You might be surprised to hear that meditation also helps to fight
            substance use disorder. Mindfulness meditation in particular has
            been shown to have substantial beneficial effects for people
            battling addiction; research shows that mindfulness training
            actually works to change the neurological dysregulation associated
            with addiction, and in some cases, helps to prevent relapse.
            <br />
            <br />
            Although more research needs to be conducted to be able to call
            mindfulness meditation an evidence-based substance abuse treatment,
            it’s worth trying if you’re struggling with relapse, especially
            considering all of its other mental health benefits.
