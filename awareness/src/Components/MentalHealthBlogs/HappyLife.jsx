          Wanting to live a meaningful life is just part of human nature. No one
          likes the feeling of being stuck in a rut without any progress. We’re
          sure that at some point in time, you must have experienced something
          similar. The almost robotic feeling of waking up, going to work,
          coming home to maybe watch some Netflix and then falling asleep – only
          to do the exact same thing the next day. These tedious periods of time
          have only increased due to the ongoing COVID-19 lockdowns and movement
          restrictions.
          <br />
          <br />
          And the effects?
          <br />
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>Depression </li>
            <li>Increase Anxiety</li>
            <li>Lack of Motivation & Focus</li>
            <li>Negative Impact on Physical Wellbeing </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <br />
          As you can see, if you don’t have a purpose in life, it could lead to
          a rather chaotic lifestyle. We’re sure that nobody would want to live
          like that. As human beings, we need to remember that our time on this
          earth is limited. So instead of wasting it by living a life without
          purpose, we should do our best to take small steps in order to improve
          it. In this blog, we’ll be discussing some ways on how you can live a
          meaningful life every day.

          <h1 className="titlestepfirst">1) Know Yourself</h1>
          <p className="parastepfirst">
            One of the first steps of living a purposeful and meaningful life is
            to know what’s important for you. A quick google search can give you
            some examples; like ‘family’, ‘success’, ‘career’. But they’re just
            that – examples. As each person is unique and may be at different
            points in their lives from others, these examples can serve as a
            guide that you can use to focus on the real things, people and
            activities that you believe makes your life worthwhile.
            <br />
            <br />
            Some other ways to ‘get to know yourself’ is by learning to be
            honest with yourself. How often do you say you like something,
            simply because it’s a fad or because you want to fit in? (Girls,
            remember having a phase of not liking the colour ‘pink’ because it
            was a ‘girly’ colour and you were ‘different. Or what about boy’s
            being told that they shouldn’t like ‘playing house’ and instead
            should focus on playing with cars and action figures?)

          Another way to live a meaningful life is to discover your life’s
          purpose. This is definitely a daunting task as most people don’t even
          know where to start. Finding your life’s purpose seems to be such a
          broad statement and people often get pigeonholed into thinking they
          only have a singular purpose in life (though that’s not the case!)
          <br />
          <br />
          The first step is understanding what meaning is and is not. “Meaning”
          is a vague term, and sometimes people think that meaning is the same
          thing as happiness. But according to psychologists and philosophers,
          the two are different. Happiness is a positive mental and emotional
          state — and it comes and goes: when you feel good you’re happy, and
          when you feel bad you’re unhappy.

          <h1 className="titlestepfirst">3) Pursue Your Purpose</h1>
          <p className="parastepfirst">
            As mentioned before, we are given a limited time on this earth. Not
            only is life short, but it is also fragile and delicate. Here one
            moment, and gone the next. Therefore, we should make the most of the
            time we have and pursue our passions – whatever they may be, instead
            of settling for the ‘next best thing’.
            <br />
            <br />
            Not only will pursuing your passion make you feel happier, but it
            also gives you a purpose to exist in this world. Should you be lucky
            enough to work in an industry that you’re passionate about, the
            workload won’t even feel like a burden to you. Instead, you’ll wake
            up with energy and enthusiasm to start another day pursuing
            something you’d love to do.
            <br />
            <br />
            From photography to drawing, working out to baking. Anytime you’re
            doing something that you love, you’ll inadvertently end up
            delivering far more value to yourself and those around you – for
            example, bringing joy to your friends and family with baked goods,
            entertaining your fans online with your artwork or even inspiring
            people with your writing.

          You know how people tend to set up tons of new year’s resolutions that
          they never end up completing? Well, there are several reasons for
          that. One of them is that they set too many goals with little thought
          on how to realistically achieve them. So instead of setting out 4 or 5
          big goals (and making very little progress on them), what you need to
          do is focus all your energy on achieving one thing.
          <br />
          <br />
          Not only does this relieve you of the burden and stress that comes
          with trying to achieve multiple tasks at once; but by focusing your
          energy on one thing at a time, you’ll increase the likelihood of
          actually succeeding.

          <h1 className="titlestepfirst">5) Spend Money on Experiences</h1>
          <p className="parastepfirst">
            A lot of consideration goes into deciding on what to spend your
            hard-earned money on. Aside from necessary material goods, we
            suggest that you consider spending your money on experiences with
            family and friends. Previously we wrote a post that explained 7
            Reasons Why Spending Money on Experiences Makes Us Happier and we
            still stand by them.
            <br />
            <br />
            Aside from making you feel happier and helping you build social
            relationships, by spending your money on experiences, you’ll gain a
            deeper meaning in your life and can discover whole new perspectives
            that can teach you valuable life lessons.

        In conclusion, living a meaningful life that is full of purpose is a
        fundamental part of achieving long-term happiness. Without a purpose,
        our lives will seem very dull and it makes it difficult to continue
        existing happily.
        <br />
        <br />
        Just as happiness is something unique to each individual, you’ll have to
        define your own purpose in life in order to live a meaningful life
        that’s true to you. A great way to see if you’ve succeeded is to keep a
        record of your life through photography or journals.
