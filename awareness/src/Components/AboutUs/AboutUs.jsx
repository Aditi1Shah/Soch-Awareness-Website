          of self awareness among general people. We fail to acknowledge a
          colossal problems, since we're not quite acquainted to what such
          issues may result in. At times we struggle to discuss the issue,
          albeit their awareness. This is due to the fear of incomprehensive
          response by the society. To deal with such hindrances, we have come up
          with a self awareness website that provides the users with a way to
          discern their problems along with solutions. Introducing our dear
