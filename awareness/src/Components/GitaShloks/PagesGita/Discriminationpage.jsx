            He is a perfect yogī who, by comparison to his own self, sees the
            true equality of all beings, in both their happiness and their
            distress, O Arjuna!

            <ul>
              <li>
                One who is Kṛṣṇa conscious is a perfect yogī; he is aware of
                everyone’s happiness and distress by dint of his own personal
                experience.
              </li>
              <li>
                A devotee of the Lord always looks to the welfare of all living
                entities, and in this way he is factually the friend of
                everyone.
              </li>
              <li>
                He is the best yogī because he does not desire perfection in
                yoga for his personal benefit, but tries for others also.
              </li>
              <li>
                He does not envy his fellow living entities. Here is a contrast
                between a pure devotee of the Lord and a yogī interested only in
                his personal elevation.
              </li>
              <li>
                The yogī who has withdrawn to a secluded place in order to
                meditate perfectly may not be as perfect as a devotee who is
                trying his best to turn every man toward Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
