                Savya-sācin refers to one who can shoot arrows very expertly in
                the field; thus Arjuna is addressed as an expert warrior capable
                of delivering arrows to kill his enemies.

                Foolish persons who do not have sufficient knowledge think that
                nature is moving without a plan and all manifestations are but
                accidental formations.
              </li>
              <li>
                There is a specific plan being carried out in this material
                world.

                As long as they have the domineering mentality which makes them
                try to lord it over material nature, they are conditioned. But
                anyone who can understand the plan of the Supreme Lord and
                cultivate Kṛṣṇa consciousness is most intelligent. The creation
                and destruction of the cosmic manifestation are under the
                superior guidance of God.

                Thus the Battle of Kurukṣetra was fought according to the plan
                of God.
