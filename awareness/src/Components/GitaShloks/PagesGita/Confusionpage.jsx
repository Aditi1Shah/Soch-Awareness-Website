            The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone’s heart, O Arjuna, and is
            directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as
            on a machine, made of the material energy.

                Emphasizing the dependence of the soul upon God, Shree Krishna
                says, “Arjun, whether you choose to obey me or not, your
                position will always remain under my dominion.
              </li>
              <li>
                The body in which you reside is a machine made from my material
                energy.
              </li>
              <li>
                Based upon your past karmas, I have given you the kind of body
                you deserved. I too am seated in it, and am noting all your
                thoughts, words, and deeds
              </li>
              <li>
                So, I will also judge whatever you do in the present, to decide
                your future. Do not think you are independent of me in any
                condition. Hence Arjun, it is in your self-interest to surrender
                to me.”
