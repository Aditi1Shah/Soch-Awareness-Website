            As the embodied soul continuously passes, in this body, from boyhood
            to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at
            death. A sober person is not bewildered by such a change.
          </p>
          <h1 className="mainheading">Meaning</h1>
          <p className="para">
            <ul>
              <li>
                Since every living entity is an individual soul, each is
                changing his body every moment, manifesting sometimes as a
                child, sometimes as a youth and sometimes as an old man.
              </li>
              <li>
                Yet the same spirit soul is there and does not undergo any
                change.
              </li>
              <li>
                This individual soul finally changes the body at death and
                transmigrates to another body; and since it is sure to have
                another body in the next birth either material or spiritual.
              </li>
              <li>
                Such changes of body account for varieties of enjoyment or
                suffering, according to one’s work in life.
