        Finding Solutions for your problems in Bhagavad Gita

        Being Krishna Consciousness- When one establish his relationship with
        god,Believe Krishna as the only supreme personality of godhead and he is
        the servant of lord. He is Krishna Conscious. One can establish his
        relationship with krishna as the same way as he establish his
        relationship with his loved ones by the give him flowers, careing and
        always thinking of pleasing him. Most people seek happiness in the body
        and its relations, but the happiness we experience in relation with
        family, friends and society always ends in lamentation. Contrary to
        material happiness, however, the happiness experienced in Krishna
        consciousness is never interrupted by suffering, but goes on expanding
        forever. Krishna Consciousness is a movement established by Srila
        Prabhupada reason is to take people back to godhead(golok Dham).Due to
        ignoring god in our life we are lost taking birth again and again in
        different wombs (such as Dog, Pig, Cat etc) due to our pious and sinful
        activites. In the material world, the consciousness of the soul evolves
        gradually from fish, plants, insects, reptiles, birds, animals and then
        to humans (including demigods, rakshasas, gandharvas etc). There are
        900,000 species of aquatic life; 2,000,000 species of plants and trees;
        1,100,000 species of insects; 1,000,000 species of bird life; 3,000,000
        species of beasts, and 400,000 species of human life. â€”Padma Purana
        <br />
        And then, finally, after having attained the human form of life, the
        soul is given the opportunity for the the consciousness to evolve from
        Sraddha to Prema, meaning an evolution from faith in God to love of God.
        Obviously, to love God, one needs to know Him first.
        <br />
        One attains the human form of life after transmigrating through
        8,400,000 species by the process of gradual evolution. That human life
        is spoiled for those conceited fools who do not take shelter of the
        lotus feet of Govinda. --Brahma-vaivarta Purana
        <br />
        In Bhagvat Geta Krishna says:
        <br />
        <br />
        After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders
        unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such
        a great soul is very rare.
        <br />
        How to awaken Krishna Consciousness? Simply by chanting 16 rounds of
        Hare Krishna Mahamantra-
        <br />
        Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama
        Rama Rama Hare Hare.
        <br />
        And following 4 regulative principle-
        <br />
        1. No Meat Eating
        <br />
        2. No Mental Health Issues
        <br />
        3. No Intoxication
        <br />
        4. No Physical Health Problems
        <br />
        <br />
        That's all.
        <br />
        In Bhagvat Geta it say's Surrender exclusively unto Him with your whole
        being, O Bharat. By His grace, you will attain perfect peace and the
        eternal abode.{" "}
