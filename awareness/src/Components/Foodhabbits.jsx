        <h1 className="singleposttitle">Healthy Eating Habits</h1>
        <p className="singlepostfirstpara">
          Eating healthy is one of the most talked-about and debated topics out
          there these days. Most of us do not eat the diet we should be
          consuming, and it can be really hard to change your ways at first. If
          you are trying to incorporate a healthier lifestyle, the most
          effective way to do this is not to follow any fad diet plans or trendy
          exercise regimes. The best way to adopt a healthier lifestyle–and make
          it stick–is to slowly change small things about your diet, and
          simultaneously develop healthy eating habits over time. Unlike extreme
          diets that rebound after a few weeks, you are much more likely to make
          your healthy eating choices a habit and keep making them for the rest
          of your life. So, while it is tough to completely change your eating
          habits overnight, we have compiled a handy list of very simple changes
          and healthy eating guidelines you can follow that will leave you
          feeling healthier and happier throughout the day!

        <h1 className="singlepostfirsttitle">Meal Prep, Even Just a Little</h1>

        <p className="singlepostfirstpara">
          You may not be quite on the level of some fitness pros yet, but
          studies have shown the amount of time we spend on meal preparation
          correlates with healthier eating habits overall. This can mean you go
          all-in and cook seven days’ worth of meals every Sunday, but it does
          not have to be that intense in order to be effective. If you cut up
          all of your produce when you get it, and place it in containers with
          clear sides, you are more likely to grab those already-prepped healthy
          fruits and vegetables instead of snacking on chips or cookies due to
          ease of access. Try this with peppers, cucumbers, and carrots, as well
          as having a carton of hummus nearby for convenient snacking! One of
          our favorite things to do is cook a few extra chicken breasts when we
          do have time to cook–it does not add much to your overall cooking
          time, but then you can shred the extra chicken for salad or tacos,
          cube it for stir-fry, or slice it for a quick sandwich, without having
          to start from scratch. Chicken is a nice lean protein and extremely
          versatile, so having it available is always a good thing. Prepping the
          chicken in advance also helps make it last a little longer in the
          fridge. Taking a small amount of time to make healthy foods more
          available to yourself will have a surprisingly large impact on your
          daily eating habits.

        <h1 className="singlepostfirsttitle">Have a Plan</h1>
        <p className="singlepostfirstpara">
          Having a plan is helpful whether you are eating at home or eating out
          at restaurants. You almost always make better decisions if you come
          into a situation informed. Have you ever gone grocery shopping without
          a list? Especially while you are hungry, this can be a nightmare–if
          you're like me, you may end up at home with a bunch of Cheetos and
          some Bagel Bites, and no full meal options. Always bring a list with
          you when you are going grocery shopping or to the Farmer’s Market, and
          plan where everything in the store will be (that will save you time,
          too). A good grocery list focuses on whole ingredients that you can
          re-use multiple times before they go bad. So instead of having
          different vegetables every single night, try to alternate between a
          few combinations to get the most out of your list.
          <br />
          If you are headed out to a restaurant, it can be hard to avoid the
          sneaky tactics menus use to get you to eat unhealthy portions. Plan
          ahead by checking out the menu, or even calling ahead, to see what can
          be made without using restaurants’ favorite unhealthy items–fats,
          salt, and hydrogenated oils. That way you will not be swayed by clever
          marketing, pictures, or “specials” advertised when you get there.
        </p>
        <h1 className="singlepostfirsttitle">Drink More Water</h1>
        <p className="singlepostfirstpara">
          Water is the ultimate superfood, and there are basically no negative
          side-effects of drinking more water. Drinking more water can help you
          feel more full, as well as increase your energy and help regulate
          pretty much every process within your body. A general rule of thumb is
          to drink your weight in ounces (for instance, if you weigh 140 pounds,
          then you should be drinking about 140 ounces of water), and very few
          people tend to drink as much water as they actually should. Sugary
          soft drinks, juices, and energy drinks account for up to 20% of the
          calories that Americans consume every day, so replacing those with
          water is a great way to see some positive health benefits. If you need
          a little kick, feel free to add fruits for extra flavor!
        </p>
        <h1 className="singlepostfirsttitle">Eat Breakfast</h1>
        <p className="singlepostfirstpara">
          To quote everyone’s mom: “Breakfast is the most important meal of the
          day.” We truly believe that. Despite making your day a whole lot
          better overall, eating breakfast can jumpstart your metabolism in the
          right way. At Bob’s Red Mill, breakfast is one of our favorite parts
          of the day, as it is a great time to get your oats and other grains to
          fuel you for the day. Check out our cereal section for some delicious
          options that are full of fiber, protein, vitamins, and minerals. If
          you want to spice it up, pile your oats with fresh fruits, spices, and
          other delicious additions–the bowl is your oyster! Eggs are another
          great option for breakfast, as they keep you feeling full and
          supercharged well into the day. Avoid sugary cereals and doughnuts, as
          they contain oils and trans fats. While they may give you a momentary
          burst of energy, they often leave you feeling tired and hungry.
        </p>
        <h1 className="singlepostfirsttitle"> Vary Your Diet </h1>
        <p className="singlepostfirstpara">
          Eating a variety of foods is a great way to make sure you are
          consuming all the nutrients that you need throughout the day. When you
          establish your healthy eating meal plan, try to add a variety of
          different types of foods–meats, fruits, veggies, legumes, nuts, and
          healthy fats to name a few of our favorites. This does not mean that
          you should eat 10 different types of candy bars, of course, but the
          more you vary your healthy choices, the greater chance you have of
          consuming all types of nutrients that your body needs. Trying to have
          as many different colored foods in one meal is a great tip as well.

        <h1 className="singlepostfirsttitle">Go Natural</h1>

        <p className="singlepostfirstpara">
          You have heard of paleo, and we support that on a basic level, but try
          to keep your foods natural and whole as much as possible. This means
          avoiding any processed foods like fast food or doughnuts. Ask yourself
          where the food you are eating came from–if you can figure out the
          answer (from a tree, from an animal, etc.) then you are probably fine,
          but if the answer is more along the lines of “from some factory, I
          guess?” then you should probably avoid it. Another tip is to rely on
          foods where you can pronounce all the ingredients. In general, natural
          foods are going to be better for you than processed, as they avoid
          excessive sodium, hydrogenated oils, and trans fats, which are three
          of the worst things for your body. In the same vein of going natural,
          you will tend to see better results by consuming your vitamins from
          food directly, as opposed to getting them from supplements. This is
          not to say that all supplements are bad, but your body recognizes
          natural sources of vitamins more easily than unnatural ones, and
          vitamins in foods are more easily broken down and processed by your
          body. Some supplements are good, especially if you have an allergy to
          certain foods like dairy and need to get some extra calcium, but try
          not to rely on supplements for your entire nutrient profile.
          <br />
          Overall, the key to gathering the right healthy eating information is
          just paying attention to what you consume. If you make a plan and
          stick to it, these simple tricks will create healthy eating habits
          that will last for the rest of your life, and won’t just burn out
          after a few weeks. Adding good things into your diet, like water and
          breakfast, while avoiding unhealthy calories like trans fats and oils,
          will lead you down the path toward a much happier and healthier body.
          One last tip is to be patient. There will not be massive changes
          overnight, but if you stick with these tips and make it a lifestyle
          choice, you will definitely start to notice your body reacting
          positively to these simple changes before too long!
