          <h1 className="titlestepfirst">1) Robert Downey Jr.</h1>
          <p className="parastepfirst">
            Robert Downey Jr. is one of the most famous and successful actors in
            Hollywood today. He has starred in some of the biggest blockbusters
            of all time, including Iron Man, Avengers, and Sherlock Holmes.
            However, what many people don’t know about Robert Downey Jr. is that
            he is a recovering alcoholic. Downey Jr. started drinking at a young
            age and by the time he was 20, he was already addicted to cocaine
            and alcohol. His addiction led to him dropping out of college and
            eventually getting fired from several acting jobs. In 2001, Downey
            Jr. hit rock bottom when he was arrested for possession of heroin
            and cocaine. He was sentenced to three years in prison but was
            released after only one year on good behavior. After getting out of
            prison, Downey Jr. decided to get sober for good. He went to rehab
            and has been sober ever since. He has said that his sobriety is “one
            day at a time” and that he still struggles with temptation
            sometimes. However, he has managed to stay sober and has even used
            his experience to help others who are struggling with addiction.

          <p className="parastepfirst">
            Miley Cyrus is a 30-year-old American singer, songwriter, and
            actress. She is best known for her role as Hannah Montana on the
            Disney Channel television series of the same name, and then as a pop
            singer. Cyrus has had a troubled relationship with alcohol in the
            past, but she has since recovered and is now sober. Cyrus first
            started drinking when she was just 18 years old. She would
            frequently drink before going out to clubs or parties, and would
            often get drunk. This led to several embarrassing moments, such as
            when she was photographed vomiting in a club bathroom. In 2010,
            Cyrus checked herself into rehab for three weeks in order to deal
            with her drinking problem. Since then, she has remained sober and
            has even spoken out about her experience with addiction. In an
            interview with Glamour magazine, Cyrus said: “I’m not saying that
            I’ll never have a beer again—I’m sure I will—but for right now I’m
            completely fine not drinking… It’s something that I don’t really
            think about anymore.”
